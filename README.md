# Cryptography-Survey
Studied the RSA algorithm, its mathematical background, and the state-of-the-art of the RSA Problem. Studied and documented a few past (unsuccessful) attempts by people to break RSA. Coded up the RSA algorithm, and ran simulations of communication between two parties and various attacks on it by an adversary. Technology Stack: Python, SimPy.
